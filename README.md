A basic Flutter Crypto App based on the Nero Testnet Cahin.

## Getting Started

It allows users to complete challenges and get rewarded with a custom FIT token

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- The backend is available at https://nerofit.onrender.com
- The vercel app is available but still under testing so might not function as intended due to flutter environment constraints.
- We've been able to successfully integrate the paymaster API and used a pregenerated mock wallet in the smart contract to test the gasless transaction features.
- The app is still in its building stage and more features will be updated as time goes on.
