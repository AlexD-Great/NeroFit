NeroFit lets you earn FIT tokens for stuff like running or yoga, tracked with a Fitbit or by hand. It’s built on NERO Chain, mixing SocialFi leaderboards with GameFi challenges, plus AI to make challenges just for you—not like STEPN, which is mostly for runners. Paymaster keeps it fee-free and simple, so anyone can join, even casual walkers. Move, Earn, Connect – Web3 Fitness for All! I’ll grow it with gym partnerships and NERO projects. Next up: build it and add NFT badges!
