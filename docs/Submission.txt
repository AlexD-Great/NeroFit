NeroFit’s a fitness app where you earn FIT tokens for stuff like running or yoga, all tracked with your wearable. It mixes SocialFi with leaderboards and GameFi with fun challenges, built on NERO Chain. Paymaster makes it super easy—no gas fees, just a smooth experience like any Web2 app. I’m aiming to get everyone, from gym rats to casual walkers, into Web3 with a community vibe. Next steps? Build it out and add NFTs for big wins!
