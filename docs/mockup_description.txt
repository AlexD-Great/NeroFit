NeroFit App Look:  
I want NeroFit to feel fresh and simple, with a green-and-black style that’s all about health and tech. The main screen’s a dashboard showing your challenges, FIT tokens, and who’s topping the leaderboard—see it in nerofit_dashboard_mockup.png. Then there’s a page to pick challenges, with progress bars and stuff like “Sponsored by FitGym”; check nerofit_challenges_mockup.png. The wallet part shows your tokens and has a big button to claim rewards, super easy. It’s got big buttons and clear text so anyone can use it, even my grandma. Think Strava, but with a Web3 spin.
