NeroFit Tech Setup (Quick Sketch):  

[You]  
   ↓  
[Phone App (React Native)] → [Backend (Node.js)] → [NERO Chain Contracts]  
   ↓                          ↓                      ↓  
[Fitbit/Strava APIs]      [AI (TensorFlow.js)]    [Paymaster (UserOp SDK)]  
(or manual entry)         (personalized stuff)     (no fees for you)  

How It Flows:  
1. You use the app on your phone.  
2. App grabs your workout from Fitbit or lets you log it manually.  
3. Backend uses AI to suggest challenges that fit you.  
4. Contracts on NERO Chain check your progress and give you tokens.  
5. Paymaster makes sure you don’t pay fees—gyms cover it.
